**Vitally Responsible** is a WordPress plugin to automatically replace image tags in WordPress content with lazy load ready responsive *images* and noscript fallbacks. 

It does not include *any* code to support the loading of these images, relying on javascript/css to be supplied outside of this plugin.

Currently uses a customised version of the [WPThumb](https://github.com/humanmade/WPThumb) class to handle the generation of new image sizes.
